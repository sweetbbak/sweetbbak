- 👋 Hi, I’m @sweetbbak
- 👀 I’m interested in web scraping, automation, anime, manga, lightnovels, audiobooks, Linux and ricing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Bash, Rust and web development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun projects that use fzf, gum, curl and other tools to bring web scraping media to the terminal!
- 📫 How to reach me @ sweetbabyalaska #0395 on Discord, or drop a comment here on GitHub.
